# Urhobo - English Dictionary

This application was built using Python/Flask to make one of the few online resources for learning the Urhobo language more accessible.

Despite having 1.1 million speakers worldwide, there are few online resources for new learners, making it difficult to learn outside of Nigeria.

Luckily, the Urhobo to English dictionary was locally published in 1986 by Ilupeju Press. This was later typed in by George Sider for Kay Williamson (†) and then edited for clarity by Roger Blench in 2005. It remains one of the most comprehensive online resources for Urhobo vocabulary today.

## Installation and Usage

Install dependencies

`pip install requirements.txt`

The search function
Currently, there is only one function: English ==> Urhobo search.

Simply type in an English word and you will be redirected to the results page, which will return all of the closest matches for that word and their corresponding translations.

## Future Updates
### Urhobo - English translation

Currently the search function only supports English ==> Urhobo searches; however, in the future, users will be able to search in both directions. Due to the additional accents used in Urhobo, allowing for searches using traditional English keyboards will require more research before implementation.

### Phonetic Spelling

I am also looking into generating phonetic spelling for the Urhobo translations, which would allow for easier pronunciation. This will take time as I am still looking to gain access to the only research paper on Urhobo phonics online.
